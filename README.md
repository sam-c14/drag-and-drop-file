# drag-and-drop-file

This project contains code that you can use to implement a custom file input button without the default display of the input[type="file"] tag,
First take out the markup from the index.html
Then copy the css code to your own css file in your project ,
After this, use the functions in the js file as you would in your project,
The getFile function should be linked to the drop event on the tag or element which you would want to implement drag and drop on,
The open file function should be linked to the click event of the label tag so as to trigger the dialog box for the input 
If drag and drop is not needed but only a custom input file tag then you can use read file or show file functions to produce the desired result on your project 
# Thanks for reading!!! Enjoy using in your project.
